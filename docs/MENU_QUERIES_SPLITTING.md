# Menu Queries Refactoring Documentation

## Overview
The `menu/queries.ts` file (265 lines) has been successfully refactored according to prompt.md Phase 1 specifications, splitting it into smaller, focused files (≤150 lines each).

## File Structure After Refactoring

### Main Export File
- **`queries.ts`** (32 lines) - Main export file that imports and re-exports all query builders

### Query Builder Files
- **`menu-product-queries.ts`** (80 lines) - Product-related query builders
- **`menu-category-queries.ts`** (96 lines) - Category, stats, and search query builders  
- **`menu-query-utils.ts`** (137 lines) - Complex SQL clause builders and utilities

### Backup File
- **`queries-original-backup.ts`** (265 lines) - Original file backup

## Functionality Breakdown

### Product Queries (`menu-product-queries.ts`)
- **`buildMenuQuery`** - Main menu query with filtering, pagination, and complex joins
- **`buildCountQuery`** - Count query for pagination support
- **`buildProductQuery`** - Single product details with images, allergens, pricing
- **`buildRelatedProductsQuery`** - Related products in same category

### Category & Search Queries (`menu-category-queries.ts`)
- **`buildCategoriesQuery`** - Categories with product counts
- **`buildStatsQuery`** - Menu statistics (totals, averages, counts)
- **`buildFeaturedProductsQuery`** - Featured products for homepage
- **`buildSearchSuggestionsQuery`** - Search autocomplete for products and categories

### Query Utilities (`menu-query-utils.ts`)
- **`buildMenuSelectClause`** - Complex SELECT with images, allergens, pricing
- **`buildMenuFromClause`** - FROM clause with all necessary joins
- **`buildMenuGroupByClause`** - GROUP BY clause for aggregations
- **`buildProductSelectClause`** - Product details SELECT clause
- **`buildProductFromClause`** - Product details FROM clause
- **`buildProductGroupByClause`** - Product details GROUP BY clause

## Query Features Maintained

### ✅ Advanced Menu Filtering
- Category-based filtering
- Price range filtering  
- Dietary restrictions (vegetarian, spicy)
- Rating-based filtering
- Search functionality

### ✅ Complex Data Aggregation
- Product images (JSON aggregation)
- Allergen information (JSON aggregation)
- Portion pricing with calculations
- Category statistics
- Product counts per category

### ✅ Performance Optimizations
- Efficient joins with proper indexing
- Pagination support (LIMIT/OFFSET)
- Filtered aggregations for better performance
- Optimized search with ILIKE patterns

### ✅ Rich Data Structure
- Main product image extraction
- All product images as JSON array
- Allergen codes and names
- Dynamic pricing calculations
- Category metadata (slug, icon, name)

## Database Tables Used
- `products` - Main product catalog
- `categories` - Product categories
- `product_images` - Product image gallery
- `product_allergens` - Allergen information
- `portion_pricing` - Size-based pricing

## API Query Types

| Query Builder | Purpose | Returns |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| `buildMenuQuery` | Filtered product listing | Products with full details |
| `buildCountQuery` | Pagination support | Total count |
| `buildProductQuery` | Single product details | Complete product info |
| `buildRelatedProductsQuery` | Product recommendations | Related products |
| `buildCategoriesQuery` | Category listing | Categories with counts |
| `buildStatsQuery` | Menu statistics | Aggregate statistics |
| `buildFeaturedProductsQuery` | Homepage content | Featured products |
| `buildSearchSuggestionsQuery` | Search autocomplete | Search suggestions |

## SQL Complexity Handled

### ✅ Advanced Joins
- Multiple LEFT JOINs for optional data
- Category joins with active filtering
- Image joins with primary image selection

### ✅ JSON Aggregations
- `json_agg()` for arrays of objects
- `FILTER` clauses for conditional aggregation
- `COALESCE()` for empty array defaults

### ✅ Dynamic Queries
- Dynamic WHERE clause building
- Parameter injection for security
- Flexible ORDER BY clauses

### ✅ Complex Calculations
- Portion pricing with discount calculations
- Rating averages and counts
- Statistical aggregations

## Backward Compatibility
✅ All original function signatures maintained  
✅ Return formats unchanged  
✅ Import/export structure preserved  
✅ No breaking changes to existing API consumers

## Benefits of Refactoring
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify specific query types
- **Readability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Testing**: Individual query builders can be tested in isolation
- **Performance**: Smaller files load faster
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different query aspects
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new query types

## Line Count Summary
| File | Lines | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `queries.ts` | 32 | ✅ ≤150 |
| `menu-product-queries.ts` | 80 | ✅ ≤150 |
| `menu-category-queries.ts` | 96 | ✅ ≤150 |
| `menu-query-utils.ts` | 137 | ✅ ≤150 |
| **Total** | **345** | **4 files** |

**Original**: 265 lines in 1 file  
**Refactored**: 345 lines in 4 files (80 additional lines for better structure)  
**Reduction**: 265 → 32 lines in main file (88% reduction)
